Weather App
======

This project was made with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JQuery.
Weather App makes use of [apixu's](https://www.apixu.com/) weather API to get weather data.
It also makes use of Google's API to get a map image and [ipinfo](https://ipinfo.io) to get location data.
Take a look at the current weather in your area!
